# HangmanGame-in-Java-by-Kuldeep
I have developed the famous Hangman game in JAVA programming language. About the game: Hangman is a popular word guessing game where the player endeavors to construct a lost word by speculating one letter at a time. After a certain number of off base surmises, the game finishes and the player loses. The game also finishes when the player accurately distinguishes all the letters of the lost word. Rules of the game: A word has to be guessed by the player. So, the output screen will display the number of dashes representing the letters left to be guessed. Then the player will guess a letter. If that letter is present in the word then the program will replace the dashes with the letter at every place it appears. If the letter isnâ€™t present in the word then the number of lifelines is reduced (which consists of finite no. of chances). The player wins the game as soon as all the letters of the word have been guessed correctly.
